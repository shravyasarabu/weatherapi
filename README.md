# weatherapi
# A quick way to understand how to use APIs using python
# RapidAPI constains a repository of apis which can be used directly for the same
# Most of the APIs used are rest APIs and the response is generally in json formats
# it helps to have a better understanding of key-value structure in a json for easier response division
# it is always recommended to use a try catch block to make sure of error handling
